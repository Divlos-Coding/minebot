## About
 This is a Minecraft Bot, that uses [Mineflayer](https://github.com/prismarinejs/mineflayer) and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/). Use the code, and fill in the config.json and your good to go! You can even make your own extra Scripts in JS, just make sure that it's in the Scripts folder.

More information will come in the future ...

## Installation
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a requirement for the bot to function. You can check [Mineflayer](https://github.com/prismarinejs/mineflayer) and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) to see which version they require.
